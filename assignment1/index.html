        <h2>1. Flatness</h2>


        <p>In ancient times inside the dark cave, where the heavy air with the scent of moist earth was bouncing off the dark walls of the cave. There lies a group of people called the people in the cave. This is the place where shadows bounce off the walls and sway away upon the rough surfaces, creating a scene that captures the attention of the inhabitants of those dwelling within.


            To the cave inhabitants, those shadows are more than just illusions of light and darkness, they symbolize the nature of their existence. Each special silhouette designed by the flickering flames, narrates a narrative in which a scene of silence comes out via the notion of movement.
           
            The Allegory of the Cave's inhabitants perceive the big object as fire as their knowledge was little to comprehend the dark objects that pass in front of the light. For the dwellers watching the shadows pass, they perceive it as living beings which represent their significance and joy to them.  
           
            Even though they are mysterious and the shadows are hard to describe. They drive the viewers to be ecstatic but not exposing their aura that lies beyond in the cave.
           
            As a result, the dwellers are questioning the meaning with no answers to provide. What lies beyond the boundaries of their world? What revelations are awaiting for the brave to experience stepping into the blazing light above them?
           
            As of now, they find peace in the shadows, waiting patiently to find out the truths that will come out one day to find their sole purpose and the answers to how the shadows work. And so, they continue to observe the shadows that pass everyday on their rough wall.

        <p>Nick Sosuani’s notion of flatness is defined as the idea of perceiving the world in an one-dimensional aspect. It defines humans not understanding the concept of underlying layers of taking things at a face value. In my own opinion, the definition of flatness means the terminology that confines the understanding to surface-level definition while neglecting the beauty and depth that exist underneath the earth’s surface. In the context of the Allegory of the Cave’s inhabitants, their view of perceiving the shadows projects their lack of understanding the concept of flatness in this scenario. As the shadows get reflected on the wall, they accept them as the entirety of their everyday life, without being curious to wonder about what goes beyond the shadows.


            Their concept of flatness aligns with them seeing the shadows in front of them as they’re living in the cave, with their narrow imagination on how the world looks like outside of the cave is destroying their ability to be creative.

        <h2>2. Seeing Double</h2>


        <p>Within the darkness of the cave, the object is hanging there, its smooth surface reflecting the flickering light from an outside source. This particular light in which Plato spoke of his Allegory in the Cave, in which the shadows are casted of the sun on the empty dark walls, giving the inhabitants of the cave a small glimpse of the outside world. These shadows, which are described as a distorted reflection of the sun, became the sole focus of their reality, a flat, black and white representation of the world outside in which it’s filled with colors of nature and the sky. To them, the shadows they see in the cave were not mere reflections but rather entities.

        <p> Nick Sousanis concept of Seeing Double in my own words means romanticizing the reality of specific aspects and dimensions in a single frame of reference, alongside indulging into the interaction between perception of reality and its difficulty to understand it. Sousani’s aspect of this whole notion portrays the comprehension and interpretation of how the world works in regards to Plato’s Allegory of the Cave in which the people have a limited understanding of what goes on in the world.


            For the inhabitants, the cave in reality is just described as a default flat representation of the shadows projected onto the dark walls in which it represents their understanding of life. As mentioned previously, it is symbolized as a dark object, with no depth. In contrast, the people outside the cave view the cave in a three dimensional manner by seeing colours, light in addition by also perceiving the context of its beauty.
